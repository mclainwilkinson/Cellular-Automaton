##Cellular Automaton Models

this repository contains my final project for a High Performance and Parallel Computing Class. Each model in the repository models the tumor growth model descriibed in the attached article. The corresponding Serial and Parallel python codes are examples of the model being executed serially and a parallelized version using MPI multiprocessing in python.
