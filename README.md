# Cellular Automaton Models

This repository contains my final project for a High Performance and Parallel Computing Class. Each model in the repository models the tumor growth model described in the attached article (modellingCancerTumors.pdf). The corresponding Serial (CancerTumorGrowthSerial.py) and Parallel (CancerTumorGrowthParallel.py) python codes are examples of the model being executed serially and a parallelized version using MPI multiprocessing in python with the mpi4py package.
